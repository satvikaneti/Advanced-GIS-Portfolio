# Advanced GIS Portfolio

https://satvikaneti.github.io/Advanced-GIS-Portfolio/

This is a portfolio for Satvika Neti's work in the class Advanced GIS at Carnegie Mellon University.

## Storytelling through data, for communities
Satvika (she/her/hers) is passionate about the power of narrative, the importance of data and technology, and the necessity for intersectional justice for all communities. Her definition of intersectionality stems from embracing the hyphens of her identity, bridging the gap between her experiences, and expanding the work an organization is doing to include more people.

Satvika is currently a student in Heinz's MSPPM-DA program, and has previously: organized Femisphere Codeswitch, a hackathon to design digital solutions for single moms in poverty, been a founding member of Rangoli Pittsburgh, an initiative created to amplify the voices of the South Asian LGBTQIA+ community in Pittsburgh, and served on Mayor Peduto’s LGBTQIA+ Advisory Council. Prior to coming to Heinz, she was honored as a Sprout Fund Legacy Awardee, by Governor Tom Wolf’s Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs as an Asian American Heritage Month honoree, and as a TEDx University of Pittsburgh speaker. Satvika Neti is a 2016 graduate of Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelor of Science in International Relations and Politics and a double minor in Computer Science and Policy and Management.

## What I hope to learn
My goal is to become a data journalist, to continue to tell stories with data in a way that helps marginalized people truly thrive. I am specifically interested in maps, because so much data can be readily understood and easily interpretable when shown in a geographic format. ArcGIS especially has tools that not only make visualization easy, but data cleaning and data collecting, as well. But I'm taking this class not only to learn more about ArcGIS, but to learn more about other tools that I could use in the workplace if an ESRI license was not possible to get. 

I'm also interested in the overlap between LIDAR and other satellite technology, and how that can be used with GIS tools to tell us things about the earth - whether that's migration or even looking back into history, to where borders or ocean levels or ruins used to be, and hope to learn how to integrate this into my skill set as well!
